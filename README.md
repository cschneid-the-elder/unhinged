# unhinged
Modify stdin with smattering of double quotes and capitalization to humorous effect.

This is a set of scripts, each of which adds double quotes and all-caps to stdin, making the author appear to be apoplectically screaching.

When I wrote these scripts, I didn't know any of the languages in which I was writing.  Surprise that the Python is not pythonic, the Ruby less than gem-worthy, and the Bash simply unworthy is to be expected.
